NEW VERSION:
Changed to simple 1-point crossover, to make more properly "genetic" rather than allowing the winning
parent's genes to remain unchanged until after the lowing parent's death score
Changed mutate to mutate all genes/moves at the same probability, rather than higher probability of mutation
of moves after death spot
